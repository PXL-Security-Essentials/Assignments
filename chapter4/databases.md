# Setting up the environment
Click the "start container" button and wait 2 minutes. When you get a public IP address use nmap to scan for open ports & services.

# Databases
For this task you will be enumerating a MongoDB database. You should have found some database credentials in the files from the samba challenge. Try enumerating using the questions below:

- What is MongoDB? How does it differ from traditional relational databases?
- Use nmap to discover if the MongoDB service is exposed. What port is it running on?
- Use mongosh (or an alternative MongoDB client) to connect to the database. 
- Explore the collections inside the relevant database. What kind of data is stored there?

Make sure you validate any flags you've found below.
